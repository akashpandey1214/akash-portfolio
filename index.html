      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a passionate and results-driven data analytics professional currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at Wichita State University. My academic and professional journey has been guided by a deep belief in the transformative power of data. With a strong foundation in business strategy, data science, and AI-powered solutions, I focus on building systems that not only perform well but also create value for people and organizations.</p>
      <p>Having started my journey in India and now thriving in the United States, I bring a global perspective and adaptability to every challenge. I've led marketing and data projects at the College of Applied Studies, developed dashboards for WSU's Department of Sports Management, and managed digital campaigns that reached thousands of users. My work has been recognized by the university’s CAREER Development and Applied Learning initiatives, highlighting my commitment to experiential education and impact.</p>
      <p>I consider myself a hybrid thinker – blending creativity and logic, technology and humanity. I'm particularly interested in applications of AI in healthcare, community engagement, and strategic business growth. I'm always looking for meaningful collaborations that spark innovation and change.</p>

      <h2>Skills</h2>
      <p>My technical toolkit spans across programming, data engineering, cloud technologies, and business communication. I bring not just tools, but context – choosing the right approach for the right problem. From scripting in Python to designing interactive web apps and visual dashboards, I enjoy building things that make people say "wow" — and that actually work.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Each of my projects solves a real problem. Whether it’s an AI-based assistant that helps manage large-scale university events or a Smart City interface built for responsive urban design, I focus on usability, efficiency, and innovation.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>ECRIS – Event Chatbot Responsive Interface System:</strong> This project features a web-based AI chatbot assistant for event navigation and updates, implemented using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5, and JavaScript. It enhances the user experience during conferences and academic fairs.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart City Simulation:</strong> Built an interactive interface integrating public services like transportation, citizen feedback, and utility control. Designed using responsive design principles, mock APIs, and data cards.</li>

      <h2>Research & Innovations</h2>
      <p>My research explores the fusion of NFC (Near Field Communication) tags and Artificial Intelligence in real-time health monitoring systems. It proposes a predictive health model using wearable sensors that transmit vitals like heart rate, temperature, and location to an AI engine that detects anomalies and predicts risks. This model was presented at the Kansas Data Science Conference 2025 and received appreciation from multiple academic advisors and healthcare professionals.</p>
      <p>The innovation lies in integrating multi-source data streams with real-time analysis and predictive triggers that could alert caregivers and reduce medical response time in critical situations. This research opens new doors in patient-centered healthcare analytics and proactive intervention.</p>
