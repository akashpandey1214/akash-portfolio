    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I am Akash Pandey, a passionate Data Analyst, Business Strategist, and AI Research Enthusiast currently pursuing my Master’s in Business Analytics at Wichita State University. With a foundation built upon both academic excellence and professional applied learning experiences, I have continually sought to bridge the world of technology and human-centered problem-solving.</p>

    <p>Throughout my journey, I have worked at the intersection of data, strategy, and innovation, focusing on creating real-world solutions that empower organizations to leverage insights, optimize operations, and enhance decision-making. I believe that data isn't just numbers—it's the story of possibilities, innovation, and transformative change.</p>

    <p>Beyond analytics, my work philosophy revolves around empathy, resilience, and constant growth. I aim to bring both technical expertise and a human touch to every project I undertake, whether it’s creating scalable AI solutions or engaging in cross-functional collaboration with stakeholders across departments. I envision a future where technology augments human potential, and I am committed to contributing toward that future, one project at a time.</p>

    <h2>Research & Innovations</h2>
    <p>My research investigates the integration of NFC tags with AI models to build real-time healthcare monitoring solutions. Using biometric data streams like heart rate, body temperature, and oxygen levels, the system predicts health anomalies and suggests interventions before emergencies occur.</p>

    <p>Key aspects of my research include data security through encrypted transmission, cloud-native AI model hosting, and predictive anomaly detection algorithms. This work was presented at the Kansas Data Science Conference 2025 and received commendation for addressing patient safety, operational efficiency, and proactive healthcare transformation.</p>

    <p>I continue to refine this research with a focus on scalability, ethical AI considerations, and real-world application in telemedicine and elder care ecosystems.</p>
