    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Akash Pandey, a passionate Data Analyst, Business Strategist, and AI Enthusiast currently advancing my expertise through a Master’s in Business Analytics at Wichita State University. My journey from India to the United States reflects a continuous pursuit of knowledge, adaptability, and a relentless focus on creating impact. Recognized for my leadership in applied learning initiatives, I bring a global mindset fused with technical precision.</p>

    <p>My professional philosophy centers on the belief that data is more than numbers — it's the story of human behavior, opportunity, and innovation. Throughout my academic and internship experiences, I have developed solutions that optimize operations, enhance marketing strategies, and introduce AI-driven efficiencies. My work on NFC healthcare technologies and smart city models underscores my commitment to integrating technology meaningfully into people’s lives.</p>

    <p>My mission is to bridge business and technology to shape organizations that are not only smarter but more human-centric, sustainable, and future-ready. I believe that great innovation happens at the intersection of disciplines — and I’m always seeking opportunities to work at that exciting frontier.</p>
