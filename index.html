    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I’m Akash Pandey — a passionate Data Analyst, Web Developer, and AI Researcher based in Wichita, Kansas. With a strong background in Business Analytics and Technology, my mission is to bridge the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making. Throughout my academic journey at Wichita State University and practical internships, I have developed an integrated understanding of how technology can fuel business transformation.</p>

    <p>What drives me is curiosity: the urge to find patterns in chaos, to solve problems creatively, and to use data ethically to make an impact. I specialize in designing data-driven systems that improve business efficiency, enhance customer experiences, and power digital transformation. My work is guided by a commitment to continuous learning, empathy for users, and excellence in execution.</p>

    <p>Outside of analytics, I am passionate about public speaking, innovation in education technology, and contributing to initiatives that create inclusive, tech-savvy communities. My vision is to lead projects where data, technology, and human understanding converge to solve real-world problems.</p>

    <h2>Research & Innovations</h2>
    <p>My research focuses on the intersection of wearable technology, IoT, and Artificial Intelligence in healthcare systems. Specifically, I am investigating the integration of Near Field Communication (NFC) Tags and predictive AI models to monitor patient vitals and environmental conditions in real-time. The solution emphasizes proactive intervention by analyzing streaming biometric data and sending predictive alerts based on historical trends.</p>

    <p>Presented at the Kansas Data Science Conference 2025, this project received recognition for proposing a scalable architecture that combines cloud-based storage, secure data transmission, and machine learning-based anomaly detection. My ambition is to continue expanding this research into practical deployments that empower healthcare professionals and save lives by shifting care from reactive to predictive models.</p>
